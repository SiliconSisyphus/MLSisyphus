How came up with LORA?
-A generalization of two questions>
  -1. Do we need to finetune all the parameters?
  -2. For the weight matrics, how expressive should the updates be in terms of matrix rank?

What is LORA?
-d->r->d(r<<d)

How do we choose the rank?

Benefits?

Does it work in my architecutre?
